# Graph-Coloring-and-Ordering-Algorithm
This repository features efficient algorithms for graph coloring and vertex ordering. The graph coloring algorithm assigns colors to vertices to minimize collisions, while the ordering algorithms arrange vertices based on their colors. These algorithms are invaluable for optimizing graph analysis and various applications.
